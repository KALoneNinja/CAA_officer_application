# CAA_officer_application
## About
This is a web application that is supposed to make CAA (Compassionate Action for Animals) UMN (University of Minnesota) student chapter officer tasks easier, more efficient, and more thorough. The aim of this application is to be able to automatically create tasks in Basecamp for officers. This will help the student group in a number of areas:
- officer transitions: The task descriptions will be tutorial-like and as such will be a great resource for new officers, thus easing officer transitions.
- officer communication: By making basecamp tasks easier to make, each task given to officers can now be tracked on basecamp so progress on that task can be tracked.
- officer capabilities: The automated task creation will allow many tasks to be made at once and split between officers so that our capability of doing more things will increase.
- student group growth: Creating clear procedures for events and tasks will allow officers to have the time and capability to implement new changes in the group (new event, meeting rituals, etc).

In the future, I hope to also automake some of the tasks themselves through integrations with other services, and possibly a web extension. This would include google calendar, and our google drive.
