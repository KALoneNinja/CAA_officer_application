For this app, I need:


My Next task is:
- store/import necessary information about events/todolists/todos in mySQL

AnnualTodo

annual_category

I have come across situations where it may be good to create a todo outside of the event todolist.
Cases that I can think of: monthly/weekly email, SSF funding, vegfund funding, room reservations. Perhaps even bringing signup forms to meetings.
These are all things that have a due date independent of the event.
The difficulty in making this work is really finding the specific todolist to put it in. We'll need a new attribute for todos called "todolist".
For that attribute, we can give a variable name to a list. This name will have to be stored somewhere. Most likely it will be mannaged as an annual todolist.

I'm really intrigued by the question of how we do emails. Obviously, if we are sending out emails for eventbrite, signup, advance notification, notification, and reminder
all separately, we will have a ton of emails! Previously we have combined a lot of these into one email. So I'm thinking a weekly email. But a weekly email is almost not worth it
since most weeks we only have 1 event. So perhaps a biweekly email would be better? With email reminders for every event?


What happens with officer changes or role changes?
- change officers
- change roles
- update todos with changes
    - find basecamp ID of officer who has added responsibility: added_id
    - loop through events
        - loop through todos
            - if todo was not made using event_category continue
            - get basecamp todo info
            - if todo complete, continue
            - prompt user if they want this todo changed
            - if they do, swap in added_id in basecamp and application
    - loop through annuals
        - use same process as events

What happens when event date needs changed?
- go through all event todos, and update date
